# Commenting and Annotation

```{danger}
Comments and annotation is an experimental feature that may change quickly!
If you're interested in trying this out, we recommend using the `master` branch
version of Jupyter Book.
```

You can add functionality for web commenting and annotation through a number of web services and tools. These allow readers of your book to share conversation, ideas, and questions in a centralized location. It is useful for classes, communities of practice, asking for user feedback, etc.

Currently, these commenting engines are supported:

- [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) provides a web overlay that allows you to annotate and comment collaboratively.
- [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) is a web commenting system that uses GitHub Issues to store and manage comments.

**Documentation for supported services**

For examples of each service, as well as instructions for how to activate it, click on the links for each service in the left navigation bar or below.
